* AoC 2021
This repository contains (some) solutions to the AoC 2021 problems.

Everything is done using Common Lisp.

Dependencies are kept as low as possible, using only:
- [[https://edicl.github.io/cl-ppcre/][cl-ppcre]] to deal with the input parsing.
- a heap package, used to have a priority queue (Dijkstra algorithm ...), modified to include an efficient ~heap-update~ operation (sometimes referred to as ~decrease-key~ in the literatture). The base package is available on Quicklisp, the modified version is in the ~heap+.lisp~ of this repository !
