* Advent of Code
[[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]] is a programming challenge taking place every year from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, a new problem is given to the players, in the form of a short 'situation' (involving elves, submarines & other cool stories). Players are then asked to answer a question about their own input (/i.e./ their problem instance). Upon giving the correct answer, they are asked a second question about the same input, usually more difficult. This incitates players to solve the first part in a generic and efficient way, as they are unaware of the second part.
